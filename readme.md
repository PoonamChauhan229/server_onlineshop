To generate and download an invoice in ReactJS and Node.js, you'll need to follow these steps:

Generate Invoice on the Server (Node.js):

In your Node.js backend, create a route that generates an invoice based on the order details.
You can use a library like pdfkit or any other PDF generation library to create the invoice as a PDF file.
Save the PDF file to a temporary location on the server.
Provide a Download Link (ReactJS):

In your React component, add a button or link that the user can click to download the invoice.
This button/link should call an API endpoint on your backend that triggers the generation of the invoice and returns its URL.
Serve the PDF File (Node.js):

Create an API endpoint in your Node.js backend that serves the generated PDF invoice.
When the user clicks the download button/link, make a request to this endpoint to fetch the PDF file.
